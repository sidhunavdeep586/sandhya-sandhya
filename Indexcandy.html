      <h2>My Favorite Candy:Almond Roca</h2>
    <h2> Facts about our candy </h2>
      <p>Almond Roca was invented in 1912 by Harry Brown and J. C. Haley, founders of Brown & Haley Company. The candy's name is said to have been inspired by Tacoma's head librarian, Jacqueline Noel, who chose the Spanish word roca, meaning 'rock' in English, to describe the hard, log-shaped confection.
